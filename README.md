# Voice Recorder

Take-home interview assignment, as per the problem statement:

1. Create a prototype web application which captures audio while a button is pressed and sends the audio over the network to a server. In addition to recording, the app should have a way to play the captured audio back.
2. Create a simple web server that receives the audio. What it does with the audio is up to you, but at minimum it should store it so that it can be played back.
3. Be able to explain the code at the level a junior dev could understand, justify design decisions, choice of dependencies, trade-offs, etc.

## How to start locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run demo
```

By default, recordings are saved to `<project root>/server/recordings/`.
